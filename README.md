my timezone is [UTC+7](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc7) (and i don't visit github very often) so  ``üí≠ I may be slow to respond``.

code in pull requests created by me after ``10.10.2023 09:00 UTC+7`` to public github repositories can be assumed to be public domain, meaning the owners of the repository may do anything they want with it, and _hopefully_ won't bug me about license changes. i don't need any attribution either, so it's a win-win for the both of us, bestire! ^-^ <!-- best tire ftw --> <sup>can someone help me with the phrasing on this i legit can't make it sound good</sup>

## the thing im currently doing/working on
i was writing an npm lib called ``wordsarehard`` to release under [gq's](https://github.com/xxxqsq) but adhd got the better of me. currently still in early design protoing stages, mostly for the ui of a demo.

oh and i got a fork of [pret/pokefirered](https://github.com/pret/pokefirered) going that makes everything funny toby fox bepis (valley granola bars). why? i got bored and discovered that there's a decomp of frlg that i can add really dumb jokes to that only i will understand. hopefully i'll get some C knowledge out of it but, knowing me, that's unlikely. <!-- sowwy4dis comment but i couldn't not commit this rant >_<;  so far i figured out how to change the graphics for the gamefreak intro, and that took ages because the only imp that opens monochrome images that i have installed is gnu's. did i mention how awful it is to work in a WSL2+vscode workflow? explanation in a couple of words: should we execute commands in the WSL2 environment? NOOOOO, let us waste the user's space by installing everything TWICE. special hates go out to mr. sonic(dreamcast dropepd the ball really hard on that one didn't it) <!-\- context: https://tcrf.net/Sega_Smash_Pack_Volume_1_(Dreamcast)#Developer_Message -\-> and [microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) -->

other than that miscellany, it's ~~candy~~ procrastination all day, every day. candy. candy. candy. candy.

## languages i know
- python
- lua
- html
- a tiny bit of js
- an even tinier bit of css
- some amount of haxe + haxeflixel
<!-- - oh and also like absolutely no experience with c-like languages -->
