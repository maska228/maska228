# hi
im a kid still in high school trying to do coding and (mostly) failing miserably.

my timezone is UTC+7 (and i don't visit github very often) so  ``ðŸ’­ I may be slow to respond``.

## the thing im currently doing/working on
procrastination ðŸ’¯

also passively learning more love2d to do the upcoming gmtk jam or the gh game-off, but that's not really interesting.

## languages i know
languages i know include some of the most begginer-friendly ones, like
- python
- lua
- html
- a tiny bit of js
- an even tinier bit of css
- the tiniest amount of haxe
<!-- - oh and also like absolutely no experience with c-like languages -->

## contact me at these rather strange locations
<sub>no hablo espanol, ingles por favor</sub>

<sub>je ne parle pas francais, anglais sil vou ple</sub>

<sup>none of them are used that often, except youtube because i need to consoom content to distract me from SOMEWHERE</sup>
