# hi
im a kid still in high school trying to do coding and (mostly) failing miserably.

my timezone is UTC+7 so  ``ðŸ’­ I may be slow to respond``.

## the thing im currently doing/working on
<sup>let's hope i won't forget to update this section!!</sup>

working on a huge idea hybrid project in haxe, with a shared theme of losing control.

<sup>aiming for a june OR spooky month release, though i will probably miss both of em kekw</sup>

the most painful thing is doing sprites because i genuinely just can't do good pixel art lmao.

## languages i know
languages i know include some of the most begginer-friendly ones, like
- python
- lua
- html
- a tiny bit of js
- an even tinier bit of css
- the tiniest amount of haxe
<!-- - oh and also like absolutely no experience with c-like languages -->
