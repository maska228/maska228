# hi
im a kid still in high school trying to do coding and (mostly) failing miserably.

my timezone is UTC+7 so  ``ðŸ’­ I may be slow to respond``.

## languages i know
languages i know include some of the most begginer-friendly ones, like
- python
- lua
- a tiny bit of js
- an even tinier bit of css
- the tiniest amount of haxe
- html
<!-- - oh and also like absolutely no experience with c-like languages -->
