## NOTICE
this account may be 502'd(moved permanently) to some other website because i can't be fucked to set up 2FA on github.

my timezone is [UTC+7](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc7) (and i don't visit github very often) so  ``üí≠ I may be slow to respond``.

code in pull requests created by me after ``10.10.2023 09:00 UTC+7`` to public github repositories can be assumed to be public domain(unless stated otherwise), meaning the owners of the repository may do anything they want with it, and _hopefully_ won't bug me about license changes. i don't need any attribution either, so it's a win-win for the both of us, bestire! ^-^ <!--best tire, fr-->

## the thing im currently doing/working on
i was writing a js lib called ``wordsarehard`` to release under [gq's](https://github.com/xxxqsq) but adhd got the better of me. currently still in early design protoing stages, mostly for the ui of a demo.

oh and i got a fork of [pret/pokefirered](https://github.com/pret/pokefirered) called [pokebepis](https://github.com/maska228/pokebepis) going that makes everything funny toby fox bepis (valley granola bars). why? i got bored and discovered that there's a decomp of frlg that i can add really dumb jokes to that only i will understand. _hopefully_ i'll get some C knowledge out of it, but knowing me, that is very unlikely.

other than that miscellany, it's ~~candy~~ procrastination all day, every day. candy. candy. candy. candy.

## languages i know
- python
- lua
- html
- a tiny bit of js
- an even tinier bit of css
- some amount of haxe + haxeflixel
<!-- - oh and also like absolutely no experience with c-like languages -->

## misc
<details><summary>pfp details</summary>
<p>
pfp is 32x32px enlarged to 1024x1024 so github doesn't compress it as much, uses colors from <a href=https://lospec.com/palette-list/s-lucky>S-Lucky</a> by <a href=https://lospec.com/anubi>Anubi</a>, with a white layer in the background that has a red/blue gradient with 95 alpha on top of it to make a cool looking bg. i'll give you the source file OR the extremely artsy meaning i made up for it if you ask nicely <3 <3 <3
<!--don't you love html in the middle of markdown using html instead of markdown link format? also, good job on highlighting the comment improperly, github.-->
